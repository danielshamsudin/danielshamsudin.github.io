"What is your name? Who are you? Do you know who my user is? Where is my home?" <br><br>

It was some questions that had made me stop on my tracks to turn back and look at Unifi-chan, seeing her troubled expression. <br><br>

Because my actions and my habit of speaking before thinking would lead me to say things that I did not exactly mean, I have to think of a way to help her recover her memories. <br><br>

I tried to disguise into a passenger who is innocent but kind, but then sometimes I keep on wondering how long can I still lie to her, about the past, and about the truth?  <br><br>

"Hey, how long you are going to tell her the truth?" You spoke in my mind, with an suspensful tone.<br><br>

"It's not the time yet......" I don't have the courage. Maybe I will if I reached to the place where I created her. <br><br>

"If the day comes, I will tell her the truth." I said softly.<br><br>

"......And then I could actually tell her," <br><br>

"Welcome back home." <br><br>

    <blockquote>
      <p>The truth is TM kun has been disguising into you (a passenger) for the whole time. He is the one who created Unifi-Chan and who she had been searching through the way to her home.</p>
