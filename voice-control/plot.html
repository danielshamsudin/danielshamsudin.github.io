    <p style="font-size: 14pt; font-weight: bold; font-family: Candara; text-align: center;">Sometimes in the quiet moments of life, amid all the hustle and bustle, Unifi-chan suddenly wonders what she used to be like. <br><br>

She can never forget spending hours with her user. She wants to go back to her home. <br><br>

"Are you lost?"  Your clean and beautiful voice, bringing her back to the real world.<br><br>

"Why not I show you the way?" You grins, eyes practically lighting up.<br><br>

"Really!?" She jumps with joyness, and all the despairing thoughts are lost.  <br><br>

She has so many things to do, racing with other internet service provider, prepare her showcase, oh and she bet that her user had been waiting forever for her to connect to the internet!<br><br>

With a new smile that could make flowers grow, Unifi-chan grabbed your hand and rushes into the morning light. <br><br>

"What are you waiting? Let's go!" <br><br>

</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Unifi-chan had an amnesia. She was lost through the way to reach her home. Your task is to bring her back home successfully using the voice commands to show her the way. So what are you waiting for? Let's start the game!</p>
